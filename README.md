# Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots

This is the repository for the code files of the **Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots** lecture at the [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control](https://idsc.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Emilio Frazzoli. The lecture covered the following topics

To format your topics into a bullet list in markdown, you can organize them as follows:

- Discrete planning
  - Shortest path problems
- Planning under uncertainty
- Game-theoretic planning
- Geometric Representations
- Steering methods
- Configuration space
  - Collision checking
- Potential and Navigation functions
- Grids, lattices, visibility graphs
- Mathematical Programming
- Sampling-based methods
- Planning with limited information
- Multi-agent Planning

The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets as well as the code to the (optional) capstone project, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
